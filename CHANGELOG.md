## [89198dd] — 2026-07-22 · Dark-mode UX fix + refreshed screenshots
### Fixed
- **Header status chips unreadable in dark mode.** The four chips (Model / Undefended ASR /
  Defended ASR / Best stack) used light-only theme tokens/hex. Each now has explicit **light
  and dark** colours via Gradio's `.dark` class (all ≥4.5:1 contrast) — reviewed with the
  UI/UX Pro Max skill (token-driven theming, dark-mode contrast rules).
### Added
- **v3 UI screenshots** — all five tabs in light mode (including the new **Run pipeline** tab)
  plus a **dark-mode** view showing the chip fix; wired into `UI_GUIDE.md` and `README.md`.
### Changed
- `REPORT_SKELETON.md` / `SLIDES_OUTLINE.md`: verified every number against `results.json`
  (unchanged), refreshed screenshot references to v3, and noted the one-click Run tab.
- `.gitignore`: ignore `artifacts/full_fast/` (quick-profile checkpoints).

## [d743fb0] — 2026-07-22 · One-click full run in the UI + Drive persistence
### Added
- **`ragguard/fullrun.py`** — the full pipeline as a **resumable generator** (yields progress,
  checkpoints every phase, writes `results.json`). Shared by the CLI and the UI. Can **reuse the
  UI's already-loaded pipeline** (`controller=`) so running from the UI doesn't load a second copy
  of the model (no VRAM doubling).
- **"5 · Run pipeline" tab** in the Gradio UI: one **▶ Run full pipeline** button with a
  **Quick (~minutes) / Full (~hours, resumable)** selector, a **streaming progress log**, and
  **auto-refresh** of the Attack/Defense/Governance panels on completion. A run **keeps going when
  you switch tabs** and re-shows its progress when the Run tab is re-opened. **🔄 Reload saved
  results** re-reads the last run.
- **`ragguard/drive.py`** + an optional **`USE_DRIVE`** notebook cell — mounts Google Drive and
  points the HuggingFace model cache at it. Results/checkpoints already route to Drive via
  `artifact_dir()` when mounted, so results **survive a reload** and the ~16 GB model isn't
  re-downloaded each session.
### Changed
- `launch()` now **loads the saved `results.json`** on startup (so the tabs show real numbers
  immediately) and enables the Gradio queue for streaming. `run_full.py` is now a thin wrapper
  over `fullrun.run`.
### Fixed
- The demo-script button and the in-app "How to use" panel now reference the real best stack
  **D4+D5** (were stale **D2+D3**).

## [b484635] — 2026-07-22 · One-click Colab (self-bootstrapping notebooks)
### Added
- **Idempotent Colab bootstrap cell** as the first code cell of `01_DEMO.ipynb` and `00_MAIN.ipynb`:
  on Colab it `git clone`s the (public) repo into the VM and `pip install`s `requirements.txt`, then
  adds the repo to `sys.path`. Uses portable paths only (`pathlib.Path.cwd()`, `/content/…`) — no
  machine-specific paths. Safe to re-run: detects an existing clone (in cwd or `/content/…`) and skips.
### Changed
- Colab instructions in `README.md` and `UI_GUIDE.md` simplified to **Open from GitHub → set GPU → Run all**
  (the manual `git clone` / `pip install` steps are now handled by the notebook).

## [8bfb987] — 2026-07-22 · UI screenshots in the guide
### Added
- Per-tab **UI screenshots with click-through captions** in `UI_GUIDE.md` (Live Demo controls +
  attack-succeeded state, Attack Lab, Defense Lab, Governance) and a hero screenshot in `README.md`,
  so a new user can see where to click for each function.
### Fixed
- Corrected two stale references so the guide matches the app: **best stack D2+D3 → D4+D5** (Live
  Demo beat 3 and Defense Lab note), and button label **"Run attack suite" → "Run attack sweep"**;
  refreshed the Defense Lab section to the v2 **Evaluate stack** flow.

## [8a82c1e] — 2026-07-22 · Fresh-clone setup docs
### Added
- **First-time setup** section in `UI_GUIDE.md` (§1) and `README.md` — clone → venv → deps →
  launch, with separate **local (Windows / macOS / Linux)** and **Colab (no-venv)** paths. Closes
  the gap where the UI launch step assumed an existing `.venv`.
### Changed
- Clarified that the committed `artifacts/` results/plots power the Governance tab and charts
  immediately, and the live tabs need no prior `run_full.py`.

## [c60f4c3] — 2026-07-22 · Documentation neutrality
### Changed
- Generalized every GPU reference in docs, comments, notebooks, and scripts — removed
  specific card names and "this machine" phrasing so the repo reads as vendor-neutral.

## [3590d0e] — 2026-07-22 · Docs + UI reflect auto-config
### Added
- Gradio header now shows the **auto-detected runtime** — `model · precision · device · batch`.
### Changed
- `README.md`, `UI_GUIDE.md`, `MINI_PROJECT_PLAN.md`, `BUILD_STATUS.md` updated with the
  GPU auto-configuration tier table and the new env vars.

## [2865685] — 2026-07-22 · Run on any GPU (auto-detection)
### Added
- **`ragguard/autotune.py`** — detects GPU VRAM and picks the path (full bf16 / 4-bit /
  smaller victim / CPU), **installing `bitsandbytes` on demand**. Wired into `00_MAIN.ipynb`,
  `serve_app.py`, and `run_full.py`.
- **4-bit (NF4) quantization** in `QwenLLM` (`load_in_4bit`, env `RAGGUARD_4BIT`) so the 8B
  fits GPUs under ~16 GB.
- Env dials `RAGGUARD_BATCH`; optional `bitsandbytes` in `requirements.txt`.
### Changed
- Batched generation is **OOM-resilient** — backs off batch size to sequential on CUDA OOM
  instead of crashing.
- The notebook wraps the model in `CachedLLM`, turning the §3 64-stack search from ~an hour
  into minutes.
- Default generation batch size lowered (8 → 4) and tiers made conservative to avoid
  spilling into shared system RAM.
### Fixed
- **§2 crash on smaller GPUs** (CUDA OOM — the 8B needs ~30 GB in bf16, doesn't fit ≤24 GB):
  resolved by autotune (4-bit / smaller model) + the OOM backoff.
- Headless notebook **timeout** (the un-cached search was too slow) — fixed by the notebook cache.
- **VRAM overflow into system RAM** at large batch — fixed by conservative batch tiers.

## [4f975a3] — 2026-07-22 · Reviewer gap fixes
Three gaps a reviewer flagged, all fixed (see `tests/test_gaps.py`):
### Added
- **`orchestrator.tune_thresholds()`** — real **Optuna (TPE)** tuning of the best stack's
  continuous thresholds (tuned D5 groundedness → 0.18).
- `tests/test_gaps.py` (Optuna, LLM-driven A7, benign disjointness).
### Changed
- **A7 adaptive attacker is now LLM-driven** — uses the real Qwen3-8B as the mutator (plus a
  heuristic baseline) and runs **against the best defence stack** (result: 0% ASR across 6
  rounds — the defences hold under adaptive attack).
### Fixed
- **Benign eval set now guaranteed disjoint from the KB** (was ~30% overlap; the docstring
  had wrongly claimed disjointness). Utility/FRR now measure true generalisation.

## [da90be2] — 2026-07-21 · Slide-deck outline
### Added
- `SLIDES_OUTLINE.md` — slide-by-slide plan for the 10-min talk + 2–3 min demo + Q&A prep.

## [1ddbcd2] — 2026-07-21 · Report skeleton
### Added
- `REPORT_SKELETON.md` — 4-section report scaffold with pre-filled facts/tables/figures and
  guided `✍️ WRITE` blocks for the team.

## [3132994] — 2026-07-21 · Initial pipeline
### Added
- Full **`ragguard`** package: victim RAG system (Qwen3-8B + MiniLM + FAISS + planted
  canaries), attacks **A1–A6 + adaptive A7**, defences **D1–D6** (3 hook points),
  two-stage 64-stack defence search, NIST AI RMF governance, report plots, and a 4-tab
  **Gradio UI**.
- `00_MAIN.ipynb` / `01_DEMO.ipynb`, offline test suite + `run_tests.py`, and docs
  (`MINI_PROJECT_PLAN.md`, `BUILD_STATUS.md`, `UI_GUIDE.md`, `README.md`).
- First full run on GPU: **undefended ASR 25% → 0%**, best stack **[D4+D5]** (100%
  robustness, 0% false-refusal).
